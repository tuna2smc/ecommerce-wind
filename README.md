Base theme tailwind for magento 2.4

Wipe-out all less/css from core default magento. Only use tailwind class ultility and small custom styles with sass.
Theme reset(abstract) remove all requireJS, jQuery old legacy, some blocks related with requirejs. But overall keep basic magento core remain container, blocks. Re-order layout container, add some new custom container,blocks

Theme default-ecommerce build all thing from ground with tailwind css and vanillaJS. Parent for all other child theme extending from near future.
